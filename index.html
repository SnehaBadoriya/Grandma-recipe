        <p> Serving: 4
        </p>
        <p> Ingrediants
        <p>For the tapioca pearls</p>
3 1/2 cups water, 1 cup dried tapioca pearls
<p> For the tea

</p>
<p>8 bags of black tea, like Ceylon, Assam, or English Breakfast
    4 cups boiling water, 1/2 cup milk, Ice
</p>
<p> For the brown sugar simple syrup

</p>
<p>1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup water
</p>

    <p> Procedure</p>
    <p> Cook the tapioca pearls:
Add the water to a medium saucepan and bring to a rolling boil. Carefully add the dried tapioca pearls to the hot water. Be cautious as you add them as they can be fragile. Gently stir the balls, making sure they don’t stick to the bottom of the pan or each other. 

Once the water comes back to a boil, reduce the heat so it’s gently boiling and let the tapioca pearls cook for 15 minutes, uncovered. They’ll start to change color but won’t all turn completely black; that’s okay. Occasionally stir the pearls to ensure they don’t stick.

After 15 minutes, scoop out one of the balls, let it cool slightly, and carefully bite into it. If they’re still hard or not soft enough for your taste, continue to cook them for up to 15 minutes longer, checking periodically for texture. 

Once they’re cooked to your liking, remove them from the heat, cover the pan, and let them sit in their liquid for 20 minutes or up to an hour. If you’re using quick-cook tapioca balls, follow the instructions on the package.</p>
        
<p>Meanwhile, make the tea:
    While the tapioca pearls are cooking, brew the tea by boiling the water, then placing the bags of black tea in the hot water. Remove from the heat and steep for 5 minutes.</p>
   <p>Make the simple syrup:
    Meanwhile, make the simple syrup by combining the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Heat the water over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Set aside to cool.</p>
<p> Assemble the boba tea:
    Once the tapioca pearls are ready, assemble the milk tea by scooping out the boba pearls from the hot water with a slotted spoon and placing them in 4 glasses. 
    
    Add 1 cup of tea and 2 to 3 tablespoons of milk.  Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the simple syrup to taste and top with ice. Stir together and taste. Add more syrup or milk to your taste and serve.</p>
